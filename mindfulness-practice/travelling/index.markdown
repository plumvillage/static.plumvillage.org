On the day that we are travelling to another hamlet, a bell is invited 15 minutes before the departure time. Please start heading towards the parking lot so we will not be late and keep the others waiting. Allow ourselves enough time for preparation so we will not have to rush. We should walk mindfully and enter a car that has an empty seat. Sit up straight and follow your breathing. We might like to observe the surrounding countryside. Let us refrain from being carried away by conversations.

When it is time to return to our own hamlet, let us find the car in which we came and seat ourselves. Let us not remain outside and keep others waiting. Let us be aware of the program and any changes that might affect the transportation home, so we will not be left behind.

If we have our own car, let us try to remain with the group and not to see it as an opportunity for us to travel separately and on our own time. Let us try not to remain behind in the hamlet, when others from our hamlet have returned.

Let us refrain from travelling into town as much as we can. Our time spent here at the village is very precious. There are many nurturing elements of peace and happiness here, such as the beautiful trees and forest, the birds, our brothers or sisters who have come from all walks of life to practice like us. The collective energy of the Sangha is the most precious thing. Let us spend our time devoted to the practice and not to let this opportunity slip by. We only go into town when we really need to do so. When we are in town, we do not lose ourselves and our practice. Let us be mindful and take care of our six senses.
