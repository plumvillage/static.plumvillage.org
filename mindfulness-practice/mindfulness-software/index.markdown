Many times when we work with our computers, we are completely lost in our work, and we forget to be in touch with ourselves. Or we may forget to pay attention to our conversations, getting carried away by juicy gossip, criticizing, complaining, or other unmindful speech.

We can program a bell of mindfulness on our computer, and every quarter of an hour (or as often as you like), the bell sounds and we have a chance to stop and go back to ourselves. Breathing in and out three times is enough to release the tension in the body and smile, then we can continue our work. Few softwares below might of help:



## Menthal


The app requires **Android 4.0** and up

Menthal provides feedback on your mobile phone usage, and thus allows you to maintain a sustainable digital lifestyle. To this end, it tracks the full range of interaction between you and your phone. Running in the background, it records, for example every time you unlock your phone, every time you start an app, and every time you receive a call. The data is sent to our data vault once a day. There we extract the most interesting indicators, such as the total time you spent with your phone or the number of times you used a particular app. On your phone, you can then browse this aggregated information, and interpret it in the context of your lifestyle.

For more information please visit [Menthal ››](https://menthal.org/) or download from [Google Play ››](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=open.menthal)

_A bell that reminds us to breathe and be mindful of our body and mind._

In the busy time of our daily life, we let our mind float away to many distractions. We forget about our body, our breath, and our mind; we forget about the unity of our mind and body. In order to remind us of this unification, the bell of mindfulness is meant for us to bring our mind back to our body. When we hear the sound of the bell, please stop what we are doing and take three breaths to bring our mind back to our body. Let this unification happen and be happy in the present moment.
