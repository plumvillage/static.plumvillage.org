In Plum Village, brothers and sisters also use computer and to help us to practice we would like to suggest few softwares that might be helpful to you




## MindfulClock


Operating System: **Linux: Ubuntu**

With the MindfulClock you turn your device into a Bell of Mindfulness. During the day, it will periodically invite the bell and gives you the opportunity to pause, and enjoy the present moment in mindfulness.

## Google Chrome Extension


_A bell that reminds us to breathe and be mindful of our body and mind._

In the busy time of our daily life, we let our mind float away to many distractions. We forget about our body, our breath, and our mind; we forget about the unity of our mind and body. In order to remind us of this unification, the bell of mindfulness is meant for us to bring our mind back to our body. When we hear the sound of the bell, please stop what we are doing and take three breaths to bring our mind back to our body. Let this unification happen and be happy in the present moment.

##  Time Out Free 


Operating System: **Macintosh**
It is very easy to fall into bad habits when using a computer for hours on end. You care about what you are doing, so can sometimes push yourself too far, or over-strain yourself. The human body isn't built to sit in one position for endless hours, gripping a mouse or typing on the keyboard. Dejal Time Out is here to help. It will gently remind you to take a break on a regular basis.
