What happens when we die? This question can be answered only when we answer another question: What is happening now, while we are alive?

We are constantly generating thoughts, speech, and bodily actions which will continue in the world for a very long time. Every thought we produce, everything we say, every deed we do bears our signature. Even when the body disintegrates, we continue on through countless ripple effects of our actions.

Meditation on death can be very productive. It can help us to be more alive. When we know how to handle death, we naturally live life more deeply, joyfully, and compassionately.

In this 21-day retreat, as we practice mindful sitting, walking, eating, and working, we will look deeply into ourselves – into our bodies, our feelings, our perceptions – in such a way that we can touch the reality of our nature of no birth and no death.

This warm and lovely June in southwestern France, as the lotuses open their pink petals wide to offer the most exquisite fragrance, let us come together as one big family to open our hearts in freedom, understanding and love.
