A community of Buddhist practitioners is referred to as a “**_Sangha_**” (Sanskrit for _inseparable_). It can include both monastics and lay practitioners. As the third jewel of Buddhism, Sanghas offer a deep well of support and wisdom. As Thich Nhat Hanh cautioned: “If you are without a sangha you lose your practice very soon.”

We would like to offer to you an “international Sangha directories” so that you can be informed, keep in touch and knows which Sangha practice in Plum Village tradition within your region.
