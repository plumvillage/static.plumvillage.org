![peace-of-mind](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/peace-of-mind.jpg)In Peace of Mind, Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh reminds us that integrating body and mind is the only way to fee truly alive in each moment. Combining ancient Buddhist wisdom and current scientific thinking, he offers concrete practices for how to relieve stress and cultivate joy. Peace of Mind provides a foundation for understanding the principles of mind-body awareness and introduces critical tools for sustaining authentic well-being.
