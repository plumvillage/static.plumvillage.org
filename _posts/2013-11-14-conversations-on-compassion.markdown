Thich Nhat Hanh (Thay) was invited by the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE) to speak at Stanford University on his life experiences and the role compassion has played throughout them. Stanford University has kindly uploaded the video of the entire exchange between Thay and Dr James Doty.
