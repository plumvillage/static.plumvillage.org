At the foot of the mountain there is a stream
take the water from the stream and wash yourself
you'll be cured.... you are cured

Under the soles of your feet, there is the Earth
Take a step, touch the Earth. Don't you feel the stream?
And you'll be free...you are free

In the heart of great beings, there is a stream
Let it flow, let it be the ground of your being
And you'll be loved...you are love
You are love...you are love
