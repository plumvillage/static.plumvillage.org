Dear Thay, dear Sangha, dear friends,

We are very excited to be “Nourishing Great Togetherness”! To all of those attending the retreat at Brock University, we wish you all a happy closing to a wonderful past couple days. During the coming months, our N. American Sanghas will be blessed in sharing and practicing mindfulness as one and with teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. We are also very grateful for the technology available to us to not only further our practice but to share, discuss, and celebrate with one another.

![](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/facebook-hashtag-150x150.jpg)Although the use of technology is not encouraged during tour events as it does not allow us to be fully present and in the moment, we offer an alternative way to become connected with our social media communities! After each tour event, we know our tech savvy attendees will have insights, photos, and updates they would like to share. In order to create a community of mindful interactiveness, we offer a hashtag (#) to be used on both Facebook and Twitter.

By including this hashtag to your post, you will be adding to a larger “news feed” that features other posts relating to the tour. This way, you will be able to share and “Nourish Great Togetherness” via social media!

The official hashtag for all posts (photos, status updates, and tweets) relating to Thich Nhat Hanh’s Tour of North America is ‪#‎TogethernessTour‬

For all posts relating to Thich Nhat Hanh’s “Calligraphic Meditation: The Mindful Art of Thich Nhat Hanh” Exhibit, the official hashtag is ‪#‎PeaceIsEveryStep‬

We look forward to sharing in these two hashtags with you throughout the tour and exhibit.

Bowing in Deep Gratitude,
Thich Nhat Hanh Foundation
