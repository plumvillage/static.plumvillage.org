July 9, 2013. 103-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the second talk of the summer and this is an English translation from the French. The recording begins with two chants followed by a talk for the children (ends at 12-minutes) and then the main talk begins (begins at 33:40-minutes).




What does it mean to say I love you? What is the most precious gift? We can offer **beauty** and **freshness**. Meditation can help; the meditation on flower/fresh. How do we cultivate stability?




Peace in the body. Peace in the feelings. Peace in the perceptions. This is possible. Joy and happiness too. The practitioner should know how to generate these. What does it mean to cultivate? We need energy, and the first is **mindfulness**. The next energy, and linked to mindfulness, is **concentration**. And if these two are strong enough, we can bring about **insight**. There are 16-exercises of mindful breathing that can help is cultivate these three energies.




  * Recognizing breath is the first exercise. 


  * Following breath is the second exercise. 


  * The third is recognizing your body. 


  * Calming the body is the fourth. 



With the next set of exercises we move from body to the realm of feelings.




  * Generating joy


  * Generating happiness 


  * Recognizing a painful feeling


  * Calm the painful feeling



Discussion and explanation of habit energy.




We now move to the realm of perceptions. The five universal mental formations: contact, attention, feeling, perception, volition. What are mental formations? Mind and store consciousness along with the manifestation of seeds. Buddhist psychology. Along with five universals are the five particulars: intention, determination, mindfulness, concentration, insight.
