> We have the ability to work wonders. If we live mindfully in everyday life, walk mindfully, are full of love and caring, then we create a miracle and transform the world into a wonderful place.

—Thich Nhat Hanh


This beautifully designed gift book contains many of the best-loved inspirational quotations and passages from Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh. Basic meditation instructions and messages of peace, love, insight, understanding, and compassion accompany two-color illustrations throughout, with blank pages for personal reflections and inspiration.

Moments of Mindfulness is a perfect journal for spiritual exploration, and is intended to be used as a personal notebook, or to simply read for everyday inspiration, and to help bring mindful practices and reflection to daily life. With illustrations by Jenifer Kent, beautiful details and design, it makes a wonderful gift.
