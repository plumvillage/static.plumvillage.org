July 16, 2013. 81-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from Upper Hamlet of Plum Village during the 2013 Summer Opening. This is the sixth talk of the summer and this is an English translation from the French. The recording begins with a talk for the children and then the main talk begins (at 18-minutes).




Meditation on the corn seed. Meditation is having the time to look and to listen. There is knowledge in this seed and it is alive. Does the plant remember when it was a little seed? Has the corn seed died? Meditation can help us see things that other people cannot see. Looking into the corn plant we can see the seed.




A teaching from the Sutra on the Full Awareness of Breathing. The exercises of breathing are simple yet can be very profound on us. The first is **recognizing**. Bringing our attention to our in-breath. We can let go of our past, of our projects, etc. and we can immediately be free.Â Buddhism is made of three kinds of energy: mindfulness, concentration, insight.




The second exercise is to **follow** the breath. We focus entirely on the in-breath and the out-breath. The third is awareness if body and then fourth we calm our body.




The next two are giving rise to a feeling of joy and happiness. We can do this anytime. The seventh exercise is recognizing a painful feeling. Then we calm the feeling in the eighth.




The art of happiness. The art of suffering.
