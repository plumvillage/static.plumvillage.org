With new blossoms on the way, and spectacular changing weather, spring-time offers us a wonderful opportunity to celebrate this beautiful season of transformation and renewal. We warmly welcome you to join our community of practice for a one week or two week retreat.

We will be open to receive guests starting **Friday, March 15th** and will continue to receive guests each week on Fridays. Friday will also be our departure day. **Please plan your retreat carefully so that you can arrive and depart on Friday.** Also, plan your retreat well in advance so that you will have enough time to register and receive a confirmation (few weeks in advance is usually enough time). We will begin accepting registrations on **December 2013. **The last arrival day for the Spring Retreat will be **May 17th.**



Please read the [General Retreat Information](http://www.plumvillage.org/visiting-us/general-retreat-information.html) page and Registration pages carefully before sending any inquiries abou the Spring Retreat. Registration is available through these pages, or go visit this page directly
