**Thich Nhat Hanh** was a Vietnamese refugee who, instead of becoming bitter after being sent into exile, set up foundations to help other refugees that were too poor to buy food and clothes. He tried to teach people to be mindful of the natural world through poetry and lectures. Even though things were bad, he did his best to remain positive. I made this portrait using his poetry and teachings because I thought that doing so would create more understanding of who this man is. (_Michael Volpicelli_)
