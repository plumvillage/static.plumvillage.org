Hello listening community. We have been relatively quiet here on the archive the past weeks and I want to provide an update. Following the Winter Retreat, our Teacher held a Monastic Retreat and a French Retreat. The monastic retreat is for the monastics only and the French retreat teachings were given in French and I have been unable to secure an English translation for the archive. If one becomes available, it will be posted.




At this point, our Teacher and monastics of Plum Village have traveled to Thailand to begin the two month **[Asia Tour](http://plumvillage.org/events/view/33/4.html)** where they will teach in Thailand, South Korea and Hong Kong. In all likelihood, these teachings will be given in English with simultaneous translation into Thai, Korean, and Mandarin (respectively). I will be making every effort to provide these teachings as they become available. The first event begins on April 4 in Bangkok.




A lotus for you.
