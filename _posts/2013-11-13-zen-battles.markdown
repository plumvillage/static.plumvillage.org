![zen-batles](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/zen-batles.jpg)One of the key tenets of the Zen school of Mahayana Buddhism is that each one of us is already a Buddhaâ€”our enlightenment is inherent within us, and the practice of mindfulness is the tool to bring this truth to our full awareness. While it can bring much relief, this simple statement does not preclude the need for practice. We must strive to always be aware of our Buddha nature, rather than waiting until times of emotional upheaval when it is more difficult to practice.

Thich Nhat Hanh takes Zen Master Linji's (founder of the Rinzai School) recorded teachings from the Ch'an and Zen lineages of the ninth century to elaborate on this simple truth and to give readers tools that can help awaken them to their true inner nature and bring forward the transmission of Buddhist teachings.
