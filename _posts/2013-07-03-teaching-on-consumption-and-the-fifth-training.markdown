June 14, 2013. 87-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the European Institute of Applied Buddhism in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into German. This is the third dharma talk of the German Retreat on the theme Are You Sure?




_Following two chants by the monastics, the talk begins at 16-minutes into the recording._




One thing we can be sure of is that there is suffering in yourself and the world. From here, the Buddha built his practice and teaching. Nothing can be by itself alone, it must inter-be with something else. Suffering is the First Noble Truth. Dukkha is ill-being, but we must confirm its opposite as well. This is the Third Noble Truth â€“ the existence of well-being. This way of thinking is the opposite of dualist of thinking and based on Interbeing.




How do we explain interbeing? A further explanation of the Four Noble Truths along with a teaching on consumption in relationship to these Truths. In our community, it is the Fifth Mindfulness Training that shows a way out.




Everything requires food. What are we feeding ourselves? According to the Buddha, there are Four Kinds of Nutriments.




  1. Edible food


  2. Sensory impressions


  3. Volition


  4. Consciousness
