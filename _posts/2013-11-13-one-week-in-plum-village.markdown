Eliane shows in a straightforward way what a one week stay in Plum Village is like.

She shows the different practices like walking and sitting meditation.
How they eat in silence and stop everything they do when hearing a bell, to be aware of the present moment.

The documentary film is accompanied by music from the album ''Plumvillage Kid'' where Eliane sings poems by Thich Nhat Hanh.

The film can be downloaded on the website [www.oneweekinplumvillage.com](http://www.oneweekinplumvillage.com).
