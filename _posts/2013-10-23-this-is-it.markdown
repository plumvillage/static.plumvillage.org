_dear friends,_

_please enjoy this practice song, an offering inspired by thay's teaching "this is a happy moment." recorded by sisters chan the nghiem and trang hai an._



[audio mp3="http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/This-is-it-w-CTheN.mp3"][/audio]



This is it! This is a happy moment
This is it! This is a wonderful moment
This is it! I have arrived in this moment
And the only moment is now

This is it! Only breath breathing
This is it! Only life blooming
This is it! Only interbeing
The only way is right now

This is it! The holy mountain is here
This is it! The sacred temple is here
This is it! The pathless path is here
And the only place is right now

This is it! This is a happy moment
This is it! This is a wonderful moment
This is it! I have arrived in this moment
And the only moment is now
