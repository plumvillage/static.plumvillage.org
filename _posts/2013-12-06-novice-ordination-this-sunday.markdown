This Sunday, 8 December at 6 am in the Still Water Meditation Hall of Upper Hamlet, there will be a Novice Ordination Ceremony for new monks and nuns.

Eight ordainees here in Plum Village, and twenty in Thailand, will receive the 10 Novice Precepts from Ven. Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh and enter monastic life, receiving new names as they do so.

The aspirants come from all over the world: France, the USA, Canada, Spain, Vietnam, Thailand and Australia. The ordainees at our Plum Village centre in Thailand will receive their transmission simultaneously online.

The Ordination Ceremony will be followed by breakfast together and a half-day of Mindfulness with a Dharma Talk by Th√¢y, walking meditation and lunch with the Sangha.

The new monks and nuns will become known as the "Linden Tree family", and we look forward to celebrating under Upper Hamlet's legendary Linden Tree later in the day.
