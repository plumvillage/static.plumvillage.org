> Is Nothing Something? : Kids' Questions and Zen Answers About Life, Death, Family, Friendship, and Everything In-between


[caption id="attachment_4189" align="alignleft" width="246"]![Is Nothing Something?](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/is-something-nothing.jpg) Is Nothing Something?[/caption]

In Is Nothing Something? Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh answers heartfelt, difficult, and funny questions from children of all ages.

Beginning with the most basic questions, “What is important in life?” and “Why is my brother mean to me?” and progressing through issues that we all wrestle with, such as “How do I know if I really love somebody?,” “How long am I going to live?,” and “What does God look like?,” each page presents a question with a short answer from Thich Nhat Hanh. Both humorous and profound, Is Nothing Something? is the perfect resource for kids with questions, and adults wondering how to answer them.

Illustrated with original color artwork by Jessica McClure.

A new book will be released in March and can be pre-ordered today at [Parallax.org](http://www.parallax.org/cgi-bin/shopper.cgi?preadd=action&key=BOOKINS)
