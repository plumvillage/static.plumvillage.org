**REVIEWS**
“Practical, wise, and deeply compassionate, Work offers us a path for discovering the joy and inspiration that lies at the very heart of our household, livelihood, and daily routines.” â€”Michael Carroll, author of Awake at Work and The Mindful Leader

“Work is a practical handbook for those who seek sanity and serenity at work. I love the beautiful simplicity of his teachings and the clarity they produce in my mind.” ~BJ Gallager, coauthor of Being Buddha at Work

“Thich Nhat Hanh has invited the world into mindfulness for generations. His latest gift is a call to return to the moment at work and throughout the day. Work gives us an opening into the happiness available in the here and now. Others may lecture, others may advise; Thich Nhat Hanh invites. I am grateful; you will be as well.” ~Franz Metcalf, author of What Would Buddha Do?
