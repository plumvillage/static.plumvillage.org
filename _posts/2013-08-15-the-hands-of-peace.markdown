I had the wonderful opportunity to photograph a dialogue between Thich Nhat Hanh and David Suzuki. Of course, I took many pictures of each of them, showing Thay's gestures, expressions as well as his open and compassionate countenance.


Part way through the discussion I became aware of the separate dialogue that was going on in Thay's hands. His hands spoke to me of peace, conviction and true empathy, reinforcing his powerful words. By_Brian Kipp_
