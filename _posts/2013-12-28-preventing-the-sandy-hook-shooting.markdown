Neil Heslin, father of Sandy Hook victim, asks Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh: What could have prevented what happened that day?

What changes could we all make to help try to prevent suffering like that in people in the future?

From the Question & Answer Session at the Art of Suffering Retreat, held at Blue Cliff Monastery in Pine Bush, NY, in August of 2013.
