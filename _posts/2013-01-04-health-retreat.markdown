We will practice with our body to awaken our mind. Revitalizing body through physical exercises focused on breath and life force: walking, mindful movements, qi gong, tai chi, stick exercises…
Let us learn to increase our physical and mental energy by accessing our hidden but actually inexhaustible energy reserves in body and mind through the practice of relaxation and the joy of living happily in the present moment, as we benefit from the collective energy of the group.

We modify our eating habits, taking only light meals to maximize the process of detoxification, to better nourish our brain and to remain clear and awake in every situation.

Then we widen our circle, discovering loving and effective ways of assisting and accompanying persons who are aged, disabled or in great physical or mental suffering including serious depression, incurable illnesses, cancer or trauma. All is based on the Buddhist teachings as renewed and applied to our own time by Plum Village, as well as other traditions such as acupuncture, shiatsu, moxa, massage, Chinese herbal medicine, etc.



The retreat is in Plum Village, where we can benefit from the daily monastic practices such as sitting meditation, walking meditation, meals together in silence, sharing our experiences in small groups, relaxation, touching the Earth, noble silence, and reciting the Buddhist mindfulness trainings. The retreat will be supported by the entire community of monastic and lay residents, numerous Dharma teachers of Plum Village, and health professionals (doctors, therapists, traditional healers, caregivers and companions…).



We look forward to seeing you soon!
