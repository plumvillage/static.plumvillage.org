Kai is a student in the Graduate Program in Sustainability Sciences and Global Leadership Initiative. He was born in Tokyo, and raised in Niigata, Hawaii, and Osaka. He attended the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) where he was heavily involved in student activism and organic gardening. At UCSC, he co-chaired the Education for Sustainable Living Program where he taught and trained students on student-centered education and sustainability activism. While living in the forest of Costa Rica without running water or electricity, he immersed himself in permaculture and mindful living. He currently teaches urban permaculture and compassionate community-building in Tokyo. Kai is a passionate advocate for a culture of non-violence and coexistence with nature. His dream is to cultivate a culture of peace and compassion with all people.
