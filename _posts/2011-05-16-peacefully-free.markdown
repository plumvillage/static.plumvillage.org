_Composed by Sr. Trieu Nghiem_


I'm so free
because I can be me
look at the clouds at play
passing over everyday
inside the sky so blue
immense, spacious and true
I'll be tall like the sky
wide enough to embrace what's inside
just like the clouds passing by
flying high in the grand open sky
everything around me will be loved, embraced and peacefully free
everything inside me will be loved, embraced and peacefully free
