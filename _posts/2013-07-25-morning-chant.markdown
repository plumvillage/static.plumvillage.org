The Dharma body is bringing morning light
In concentration our hearts are at peace
A half smile is born upon our lips
This is a new day we vow to go through it in mindfulness
The sun of wisdom has now risen shining in every direction
Noble sangha diligently bring our mind into meditation

Namo Shakyamunaye Buddhaya
