Yesterday was the arrival day for our Christmas week, as Plum Village welcomed people from around the world to join us for this deeply joyful and time of "coming home" together as a spiritual family. Every bed is full!

The hamlets are already beautifully decked with greenery, berries and wreaths, and yesterday the sisters began to deliver freshly-made spring rolls to our neighbours and local businesses who support us throughout the year.

The kitchens are fragrant with Christmas spices, as each hamlet prepares their own special dishes for celebrations on Christmas Eve in Upper Hamlet. Tonight the monastic Christmas Choir will set off candlelight carolling around homes close by.
