Dap di dap.....

I'm sitting here in this lovely room
Under the light of the big full moon

Enjoying my time
I've got nothing to do
I'm hanging around
Just being with you
And awakening happens 
and I'm mindful 

I'm moving around on my feet
not going too fast
nobody to meet
I'd like to open my heart to you
I feel so happy 
just walking with you
And awakening happens
And I'm mindful 

Chorus
How wonderful!
How wonderful!
Today we're looking at the full full moon
and all that we can see 
is a fresh new plum plum tree

What a wonder-wonder-what a wonderful moon
What a wonderful night
Being here together just feels so right
We know that we are free
There's no other place to be

[Bridge:]
Meditation is so good for me
Meditation gives me a path that sets me free

Dap di dap.....
