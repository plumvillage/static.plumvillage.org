You are warmly invited to visit Plum Village and practice with our growing international community of practice and to enjoy the wonderful energy of mindfulness. The Summer Retreat is for us to enjoy simple and peaceful living, and thereby nurture our own inner growth.  We take time to look deeply in order to transform both our individual difficulties and the difficulties in our society.

Our practice at Plum Village helps us weave mindfulness into all of our daily activities. In this way we can practice meditation throughout the day, while eating, walking, working mindfully, sitting in meditation, or enjoying a cup of tea together. All visitors participate in communal activities such as arranging the meditation halls, preparing meals, cleaning bathrooms, emptying garbage, watering plants, washing pots, cleaning the kitchen and other tasks as part of the daily practice of mindfulness.  At Plum Village we emphasize community practice – so that we can support each other, and learn to live in together in harmony.  We ask everyone to contribute to the collective energy of practice by joining in all the scheduled activities. Guests are requested to refrain from smoking, drinking, and sexual practice during their stay; this supports everyone’s practice, lay and monastic. Once a week, there will be an opportunity to receive the five Mindfulness Trainings. The Trainings are the foundation of the Plum Village community, bringing happiness and meaning to all that we do.

_In order to deepen your practice and make mindful living a vital part of your daily life, we request you stay a minimum of one week_.
