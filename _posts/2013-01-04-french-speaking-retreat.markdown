## 




We are happy to announce the annual 7 day retreat for French speakers which will take place from Friday 15th to 22nd May, 2013.

During this week long retreat, Thay (Venerable Thich Nhat Hanh) will offer a series of four talks including a Question and Answer session all in French.



In addition to Dharma talks by Thay, activities will include sitting meditation and chanting, walking meditation, circle sharing (family groups of approx. 25), total relaxation and Qi Gong stick exercises. There will be a presentation of the Five Mindfulness Trainings and the practice of Beginning Anew.



This is a wonderful opportunity for French-speaking practitioners to come together for a joyous celebration of the Dharma to build the French Sangha and to hear Thay offering his profound teachings directly in French.



Translation into English and other languages will be available for Thay's talks as required and other activities where possible. There will be an English-speaking family to join so that non-French speakers can also participate in Dharma Sharing.
