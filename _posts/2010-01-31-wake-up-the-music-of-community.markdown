We're planting seeds for new communities
It's time to wake up
To be the change in the world we want to see
It's time to open up
To redefine society
No, don't give up
We're planting seeds for new communities
Please wake up

Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
Please realize
Wake up
You are skillful and wise
Wake up

She dreamed bigger, she dreamed brighter
She had the energy of wholeness to guide her
And when she stopped to look inside her
She listened to her inner voice and said:
I can feel it's been my choice to live in this new way
To take time each day to meditate and to pray
It is a new day, and there is so much more I need to say
So I'll be walking on the Earth in this sacred way

We're planting seeds for new communities
It's time to wake up
To be the change in the world we want to see
It's time to open up
To redefine society
No, don't give up
We're planting seeds for new communities
Please wake up

Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
Please realize
Wake up
You are skillful and wise
Wake up

Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
It's a new sunrise
Wake up
You are beautiful and wise
Wake up
Wake up

Walking on the path he could hear his heart whisper
Keep your spirit growing bigger, keep flowing in this river
Believe in yourself, let your heart be your guide
And you can use your suffering to grow your heart wide
There is more wonder in the world than you can see
Now stay true to your path, you don't have to see how
Compassionate and kind to your body and your mind
Patience: it takes effort and time
One day at a time
One day at a time

We're planting seeds for new communities
It's time to wake up
To be the change in the world we want to see
It's time to open up
To redefine society
No, don't give up
We're planting seeds for new communities
Please wake up

Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
Please realize
Wake up
You are skillful and wise
Wake up

Wake up
Open your eyes
Wake up
It's a new sunrise
Wake up
You are beautiful and wise
Wake up
Wake up

Let the music take you
Let the music wake you

We are coming together from all ten directions
'Cause we have a deep affection for the truth
We are the youth of all ages, more than just Facebook pages
We are living, breathing realities
We are new loving compassionate inclusive sustainable communities

We're planting seeds for new communities
It's time to wake up
