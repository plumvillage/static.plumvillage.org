We hope you enjoy this video of America's Fox News visit to the opening of Thich Nhat Hanh's Calligraphy exhibition in New York on September 5th. The Exhibition, _Calligraphic Meditation: The Mindful Art of Thich Nhat Hanh_, at ABC Home, 888 Broadway, New York, will close on December 31st, after a three-and-a-half month run.

The Exhibition is a collection of some of Thich Nhat Hanhâ€™s most poignant and most recent calligraphies, on display in the United States for the first time. In the last three months, thousands of people have had a rare opportunity to spend time in the presence of his art, which can be a meditative practice in itself.

A number of special events have been hosted in the exhibition space, including sitting meditations and panel conversations with monks and nuns, and students of Thich Nhat Hanh. 

The October 10th event, "Slowing down, finding meaning: mindfulness in an urban landscape", was hosted by American public radio personality Ira Glass. The November 14th event, "Consuming mindfully: living with respect for ourselves and our planet", was hosted by The New York Times's Jeff Gordinier, and featured Harvard's pioneer of mindful eating, Dr Lilian Cheung.
