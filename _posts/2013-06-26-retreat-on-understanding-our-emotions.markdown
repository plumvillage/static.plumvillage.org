June 5, 2013. 53-minute dharma talk given by Thich Nhat Hanh from the [European Institute of Applied Buddhism](http://www.eiab.eu/) in Waldbrol, Germany. The talk is given in English with simultaneous translation into Dutch. This is the first dharma talk of the Dutch Retreat on the theme Understanding Our Emotions.




_Editor’s Note: We had a number of technical difficulties with the recording for this talk and so portion of it are missing. _




Handling emotions. Using mindfulness. Recognizing fear and anger. Using our breath and step to practice mindfulness.




In Buddhist psychology, we speak of seeds. Seeds in our consciousness. What are they? Store consciousness and mental formations.
