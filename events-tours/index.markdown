Plum Village local sanghas all over Europe organise days of mindfulness, weekend retreats and other get-togethers, where everyone has a chance to enjoy mindfulness practices with the support and energy of a group. These events are a chance to nourish ourselves with walking meditation, sitting meditation, mindful meals, dharma sharing, music or relaxation. The energy of mindfulness generated by the collective practices enables us to touch peace, joy and freedom, even during a short event. All events in the Plum Village tradition are organised in the spirit of the Five Mindfulness Trainings (vegetarian, no alcohol, no smoking etc), and harmonious community living.

The events below have been submitted by sanghas across Europe who follow the Plum Village tradition of mindfulness practice.

Please note that the list is only lightly moderated. All events are independently organised, free from regulation or certification.

Plum Village (Communaut√© Bouddhique Zen du Village des Pruniers) is not responsible for these events.
To submit an event your sangha is organising, please **register** as a **contributor**.
