We request that you wear non-revealing clothing at all times while staying at Plum Village: long or short sleeve shirts covering the upper body, and pants, shorts, or dresses, that are roughly knee length.

Simple, casual clothing, that is easy to wash, is best. Inside the meditation hall, please wear a proper shirt, long pants or a calf-length skirt. For all Dharma talks, formal lunches, tea meditations, and the other various festivals, remember to bring something nice to wear.
