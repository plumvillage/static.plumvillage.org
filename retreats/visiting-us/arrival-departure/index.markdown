Please make your travel arrangements so that  you can arrive at Plum Village on Friday, _**except when indicated differently for special retreats such as our Summer Opening, French Retreat, Health Retreat or 21-Day Retreat, etc. **_**P****lease do not arrive earlier or later than the specified arrival day**. We provide transportation to and from the station in Ste Foy la Grande on arrival and departure days if you let us know what time your train is arriving. Please arrive before 18:00 so you have time to really arrive and settle in or to pitch your tent before dinner time (depending on the season).

We shall give an orientation about our basic practice to new arrivals either on Friday evening or Saturday morning. The orientation gives essential information about our practice and is designed to help you enjoy your stay, even if you have been to Plum Village before.
