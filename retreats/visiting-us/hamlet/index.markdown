Plum Village is actually composed of three separate monasteries, ****called **Hamlets.**

**New Hamlet** and **Lower Hamlet****** are home to about 50 Plum Village nuns each. If you are a woman coming on your own, please register once only at _either_ New Hamlet _or_ Lower Hamlet. They are located about 18 kms apart.

**Upper Hamlet** is where the Plum Village monks live and practice. If you are a man coming on your own, please register to the Upper Hamlet.

All hamlets accept couples and families.

If you are arriving together with a member of the opposite gender, and wish to room _together_, you can register at any of the 3 hamlets, however the following requirements must be met:



	
  1. Either you are blood relatives or

	
  2. _Both_ members must be above 35 years of age and

	
  3. Must be in a long-term relationship, made known to family & friends


If you are arriving together with a member of the opposite gender and wish to room _apart_, then **please register separately **to the respective Hamlet.

Please send all questions/concerns to the appropriate [Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/) so that we may get back to you in as timely a manner as possible.



_Please note that the Registration Offices in the three hamlets have different opening hours._
