**Teachings**: 
Teaching will be given in French, English, or Vietnamese; simultaneous translations for these languages will normally be available. Translation into other languages (for example, German, Dutch, Spanish, or Italian) are available depending on the need.

**Interviews**: 
In general, our teacher is not able to give personal interviews to students and guests who come to Plum Village. We are encouraged to offer written questions, which Tháº§y can answer in his talks or during Question and Answer sessions. Monastic members of our community are also available for consultation.
