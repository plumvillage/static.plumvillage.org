All housing is organized in community fashion, and most living areas and all rooms are shared, to encourage the aspect of community living and mutual support in our practice. If a room with two beds for a couple is too expensive, you may consider staying separately in the single-sex dormitories (for men at Upper Hamlet and for women in Lower Hamlet or New Hamlet). See housing preferences below.

We will provide a mattress and a pillow. We encourage you to bring your own warm sleeping bag and sheets to ensure comfort at night. This will also to help us to reduce our carbon footprint by using less energy to wash linens.

**PUB-2**: **** Sharing room with public bathroom, and **2** indicates number of bed in the room
