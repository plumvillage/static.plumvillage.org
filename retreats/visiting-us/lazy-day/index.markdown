One day a week at Plum Village is Lazy Day. There are no scheduled activities and the bell will only be invited to announce meal times.

Lazy Day is an opportunity to let the day unfold in a natural way while still maintaining mindfulness. We can enjoy being with friends, taking a walk, reading a book, or just relaxing and enjoying the day in mindfulness; our meditation halls will be open for those who enjoy sitting meditation.

We ask everyone to stay within the monastery on lazy day in order to fully benefit from this special day.
