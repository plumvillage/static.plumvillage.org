You are welcome to join us for Days of Mindfulness throughout the year. Days of Mindfulness take place every **Thursday** and **Sunday**. _Prior registration is not required_, but please telephone [Upper Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/), [Lower Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/) or [New Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/) to confirm the start time and venue (we rotate between the Three Hamlets).

On Days of Mindfulness the whole community comes together to listen to a Dharma Talk (teaching), practice walking meditation, mindful eating, smiling and breathing  together. The Dharma Talks are primarily given by our teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh or on the rare occasion a resident Senior Dharma Teacher.

A sample schedule is as follows:

09:00 Arrive and Settle In
09:30 Dharma Talk Begins (please do not enter the Meditation Hall after the Talk has begun)
11:30 Walking Meditation
12:30 Lunch Together in Silence
13:30-15:00 Break / Rest
15:00 Dharma Sharing
16:30 Return Home

Please bring a set of earphones, and an extension cable (at least 3m). The Dharma Talks are given in either French, English or Vietnamese. If you do not understand any one of these languages, translation is available. A vegan lunch is provided for everyone. We welcome donations, or _dana_ (generosity), as a contribution towards the meal and the facilities we provide (meditation hall, sound system, bathrooms....) The Donation Boxes are located in the hamlets' Dining Halls.
