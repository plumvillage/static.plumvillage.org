You are welcome to visit us (not to stay in Plum Village) for a single day during our Days of Mindfulness (DoM). Days of Mindfulness are open to the public and occur every **Thursday** and **Sunday**. _Attending a DoM does not require any prior registration_, but please make a call to either [Upper Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/), [Lower Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/) or [New Hamlet](http://plumvillage.org/retreats/visiting-us/hamlet/) to make sure of the time and venue of the next DoM (we rotate between the Three Hamlets).

This is the day where the whole community comes together to receive teachings, walk, eat, smile and breathe together. The Dharma Talks are primarily given by our teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh or on the rare occasion a resident Senior Dharma Teacher. 

A sample schedule is as follows:

09:00 Arrive and Settle In
09:30 Dharma Talk Begins (please do not enter the Meditation Hall after the Talk has begun)
11:30 Walking Meditation
12:30 Lunch Together in Silence
13:30-15:00 Break / Rest
15:00 Dharma Sharing
16:30 Return Home

Please bring your earphones. The Dharma Talks are given in either French, English or Vietnamese. If you do not understand any one of these languages, translation is available. A vegan lunch is provided for everyone. You are welcome to offer a donation, or dana (generosity), as your means allow. The Donation Box is located in each Hamletâ€™s dining room, or else just ask any monk or nun you see.
