Thây gives approximately 100 dharma talks per year. Your generous support will pay for the hardware, software, internet services, and the time to annotate each talk throughout the year. The talks will continue to be freely available on the [Thich Nhat Hanh Dharma Talks](http://tnhaudio.org/), [Lang Mai](http://langmai.org), and [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/plumvillage).

Thây has offered us a vision of building an online monastery, or online temple, where practitioners may come not just to receive information, but to practice online: to follow their breathing, experience guided meditation, interact with monastics and lay practitioners, etc.

By making a donation you are helping to manifest the conditions for such a resource to greater meet the needs of people throughout the world. In this way you support all of us in our practice, whether we are just temporarily away from a practice center or whether this online monastery is our only connection to a living, practicing Sangha.

Thank you for your practice and for your generosity
