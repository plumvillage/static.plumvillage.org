Thay has offered us a vision of building an online monastery, or online temple, where practitioners may come not just to receive information, but to practice online: to follow their breathing, experience guided meditation, interact with monastics and lay practitioners, etc. This live streaming of Thay's talks takes a few mindful steps in this direction. By making a donation you are helping to manifest the conditions for such a resource to greater meet the needs of people throughout the world. In this way you support all of us in our practice, whether we are just temporarily away from a practice center or whether this online monastery is our only connection to a living, practicing Sangha. Thank you for your practice and for your generosity. **Donate Now through PayPal:**
