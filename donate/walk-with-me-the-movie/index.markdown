Thich Nhat Hanh, the Vietnamese monk Martin Luther King Jr. nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, is one of the most popular Zen Buddhist teachers of all time, and is widely acknowledged for introducing mindfulness to the western world.

Also, a human rights activist, poet and successful author, his books have sold in their millions worldwide, and for the last fifty years his own practice of mindfulness has touched the hearts and minds of people looking for a lifestyle that’s free from anxiety and stress.

Two years ago, for the very first time, Thich Nhat Hanh’s monastics invited filmmakers Max Pugh and Marc Francis into their monasteries to witness the depths of their practice and the essence of their mindful living.

Filming in the depths of winter in their monastery in France, the team also travelled on the road with Thich Nhat Hanh and his monastics to Europe and North America; capturing their journey from Vancouver to Mississippi, New York, Washington, San Diego and London.

Through intimate interviews and observational filming, “Walk With Me – On The Road With Thich Nhat Hanh”, offers a rare insight into monastic life and the deeply personal reasons why Thich Nhat Hanh’s monks and nuns decided to leave their families and follow in his footsteps.

Honest and heart-warming, Walk With Me touches on the universal themes of belonging, love, loss, hope and death; relevant for not just Thich Nhat Hanh’s monks and nuns but for us all.
