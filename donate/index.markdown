The mindful teachings and loving practice of Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh invite each of us to enjoy a moment of happiness with each breath and step we take.

Thich Nhat Hanh–affectionately referred to as Thầy (teacher)–brings the art of mindful living and engaged Buddhism to the world, transforming suffering and bringing peace to millions. Now, in this moment, we each have a joyful opportunity to support Thầyʼs teachings.

The Thich Nhat Hanh Foundation works mindfully to engage our community in joyful giving to support Thầyʼs mindful teachings and loving practice around the world.

The financial support we can provide is only made possible with the generous hearts and loving commitment of people like you want to give back to Thầy’s practice. Gifts given for general support provide needed funding for many of our mindfulness practice efforts. It is also possible to designate your gifts for programs or practice centers especially close to your heart.

Of your general support contributions…



	
  * 20% goes to each of our three North American Practice Centers - Blue Cliff, Deer Park, and Magnolia Grove Monasteries.

	
  * 20% is distributed to Plum Village Monastery in France, home of Thầy.

	
  * 10% is provided for Dharma sharing programs.

Please consider joining the Thich Nhat Hanh Foundation by becoming a monthly supporter in this moment. A monthly gift of $5, $10, $50 or whatever you can afford, will support our community on an on-going basis. Monthly giving is also convenient, simple, and the best way to ensure the continuation of Thầyʼs teachings into the future.

_A lotus for you, a Buddha to be._
