Since it's opening in 2000, Deer Park Monastery has become the spiritual home for many practitioners who regularly participate in our Days of Mindfulness and ongoing retreats. In order to accommodate for the needs of the Deer Park Community we have initiated the Nunnery Building Project.

This project will create a central living place for the nuns to live and practice together. It will also enable us to renovate the remaining buildings and use them guest accommodation for lay women practitioners, couples or families who wish to practice with the nuns. Currently the nuns are spread out in two separate areas in Clarity Hamlet and the remaining rooms have only enough space for 8 to 12 lay women practitioners but no space for families or couples.

To be able to realize this project we need your support. All contributions are warmly welcome (donations are tax-deductible*).

**TIMELINE**:
We expect to begin construction no later than April 1, 2014.
TOTAL PROJECT FUNDING NEED: $1.7 million
As of June 1, 2013, $300,000 has been raised for the project.

Supporting our monastic community is an honor, and a way to express our deep gratitude for all that they do for us. Our monastic Sisters are our gentle teachers of mindfulness, love, and understanding. To support them in the loving work they do, please consider making a special gift to the Nunnery Project.
