![](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/happy-farm-logo-150x150.jpg)Mother Earth is calling out for our love and farming is a practice of meditation on our love and connection to her. Cultivating the land, transforming the elements, harvesting the fruits of the season, and observing the rhythms of nature are all practices of understanding, love, and mindfulness. With mindfulness and concentration, we can come in touch the earth, the sky, and the wonders of life. We feel our intimate connection with the planet as a living breathing being and cultivate our gratitude and reverence for this miracle. From this process, we also touch healing and transformation within ourselves and gain a sense of our place and responsibility to the planet. Peace within oneself; peace on Earth.

**Happiness is the harvest**
_farming in the present moment_

“There is no way to the harvest; harvest is the way” is a teaching that was taught by our teacher, Thầy, to our three lay residents of Happy Farm during the TET New Year’s festival. Farming is not about the future, about plans and waiting for the fruits to arrive. Happiness is a fruit that we can harvest each day, each moment as we practice with the land. When we sow the seeds, cultivate the land or water the plants, we can be happy right in the present moment; and the quality of the harvest depends on our peace and happiness. The quality of our being, our peace and freedom is crucial to the practice of farming.

**Togetherness is the farm**
_community and practice_

We have observed many young people are increasingly interested to live in community and to practice organic farming. Happy Farm brings these two elements together under the umbrella of the mindfulness practice. Happy Farmers practice to live together in harmony, building brotherhood and sisterhood while cultivating their own spiritual growth. The harvest, the plans and the projects are secondary to the practice of living in harmony and mindfulness. Happy farming is a collective effort. We practice to farm as a family, as a spiritual community;taking care of each other’s wellbeing and spiritual growth. We share the same space and practice to observe the Five Mindfulness Trainings and the Six Harmonies while we farm with the community. Spiritual cultivation and mindfulness training are essential aspects of Happy Farmers.

**West Lake Hamlet**
_Site for project_

Happy Farm is located in a hamlet adjacent to Son Ha Temple and at the foot hill of Upper Hamlet, Plum Village. The land has enough open space to potentially provide for the entire Plum Village community, a large pond and spring source for irrigation, and a modest house to accommodate the Happy Farmers, interns, and volunteers.

**Sustainability**
_Education and training_

We have the intention to significantly grow all our vegetable foods (vegetables, fruit and possibly grains as well), to eventually provide for all three hamlets of the Plum Village Community, and to use permaculture and other sustainable methods that respect the local environment. Happy Farm aims to be a model for our other practice centers worldwide by providing opportunities for visitors to learn
and have direct and concrete experience of organic farming, community living and mindfulness practice; as well as other ecological explorations. Our motto:


> Togetherness is the farm
sustainable humans
sustainable community
sustainable farm


**
Interenship Program**
_join and learn_

![](http://plumvillage.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/happy-farmers-300x193.jpg)Currently, there are three lay core happy farmers (Stuart, Daniel, and Keith) living at the Happy Farm and three monks are advisors and mentors (Brothers Pháp Độ, Pháp Dung, Pháp Lưu) to the project. Because of the initial conditions and location, Happy Farm is looking only for young men (18 to 35) interested in organic farm ing and community living; as well as for experienced farmers of any age who want to experience community living.
Interns are asked to make a one year commitment and come initially for the Three Month Winter Retreat and stay onwards for the continuing nine months. At the moment, interns are not paid but may receive some pocket money as needed.
Interns will practice and serve under the guidance of the core farmers and their spiritual mentors and are expected to participate in certain community activities, and as well as contribute to the farming responsibilities which may include: general yard & garden planning and maintenance, expansion of land in productive use, planting gar-dens, maintaining garden plots, harvesting produce, etc. Interns are required to follow the practices as guided by the spirit of the Five Mindfulness Trainings — vegetarian meals, no alcohol, smoking, etc. Please contact the Happy Farm team for more information.

**Supporting Happy Farm**
_donate and support_

The farm just made baby steps this year with its first harvest this Spring 2013. We have had many lay friends show their support for the project, contributing to the cost of upstarting the farm as well as to the physical labor. The farm had one major supporter from England that helped the farmers to purchase equipment, seeds, and other farming items; and also to have a small stipend for their personal expenses. We hope to invest more into the infrastructure of the farm for the 2013-14 season so more funds will be needed.
All donations and support of any kind are welcomed. Please visit our facebook site to donate online or email us if you have any questions and other ideas of how to support Happy Farm.
